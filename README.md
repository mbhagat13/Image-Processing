# Image-Processing
Each lab involved setting up various image processing functions to obtain the desired output image. The folders all contain a main file, Assignmentn.m, where n is the assignment number. Each main file has various sections which use the image processing functions to complete the assigned task.

To see the validity of any function, open the corresponding main file in MATLAB and run the section which has the desired function.

Note: Lab 1 has an additional main file titled ELEAssignment1Bonus.m for the bonus questions.
